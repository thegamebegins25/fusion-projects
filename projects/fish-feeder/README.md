# Automatic Fish Feeder

WARNING: `Auto-Fish Feeder d2 v5.f3d` is extremely memory intensive and may cause Fusion 360 to crash.

Automatic fish feeder for my sister's fish tank. The feeder is designed to be mounted on the edge of the fish tank and dispenses fish food at a set time each day. The feeder is powered by a stepper motor and controlled by an ESP-32.
