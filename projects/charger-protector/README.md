It keeps your cords from fraying and only takes about an hour to 3D print, saving you $50 or more on replacement cords. It's also great for under-couch chargers.

Yes, it's really tight—that's on purpose.

This is the small version of the design found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4814103 (the large version). They both work the same, but this small one has airflow.

Note: Some of the files include my charger render dummy. Don’t worry about it—it doesn’t do anything; it’s just there for display.

If your charger is hard to insert, check the USB port orientation. If it’s too easy to insert, that's not ideal either—you want a snug fit. To remove the charger, use pliers or something better than your fingers.
